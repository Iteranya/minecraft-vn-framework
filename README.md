Hewwo~

Thank you for keeping an eye out

Anyway, this is my take on remaking the Visual Novel Framework again

I've realized that the current Python SDK -> Java Mod workflow is a bit too hard


Also this mod has literally no Multiplayer Support

So.......

I'm gonna see if I can fix all of the above with this one! Don't worry, old script will stay compatible with this guy~
